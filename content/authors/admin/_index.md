Hi, my name is Anokh Palakurthi. I'm a marketing associate for a Boston retail consulting firm by day, but I moonlight as a freelance writer and author. \
\
In addition to writing my first book, "The Book of Melee," in 2019, I have freelance written for [Deadspin](https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/uconns-bacon-jalapeno-mac-and-cheese-a-sober-students-1735290737), [Tempo Storm](https://tempostorm.com/articles/national-arcadian), [Red Bull](https://www.redbull.com/us-en/ssbmrank-2016-4-6-red-bull-esports), and [Panda Global](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuMvZiflX_g), typically within the world of - you guessed it - professional Super Smash Bros. Melee. Currently, I write and produce videos for the [Melee Stats YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSkemv_CrepoaGxN4sAH5eA): a longtime content collective of the Melee scene's most dedicated researchers and writers. \
\
While my most of my experience writing has involved gaining expertise over one niche, I have several other interests that I write about. Every month, I review books on my [Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/119479502-anokh-palakurthi), typically on international politics, and I currently write for the Democratic Left, the quarterly magazine for the Democratic Socialists of America. Moving forward, I hope to pursue more work within the left media and entertainment space, as well as continue staying involved within [Melee Stats](patreon.com/meleestats).

Hi!\
\
From the start of my career, I have committed myself to discovering and sharing unique stories. My experience is within B2B digital marketing, competitive gaming, large-scale event planning, and independent niche journalism.\
\
In May 2019, I published [The Book of Melee](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1080789960), a historical recap of the professional Super Smash Bros. Melee community.
